      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact is a further continuation of the same artifact that I used previously for Milestone 2, the Android weight-tracking application. I originally created this application in CS-360 about a year and a half ago. I improved the software engineering and design aspects for this same artifact in Milestone 2. This app is used to record the weight and calorie logs for a user over time, while emphasizing on the short-term success of weight loss by rewarding stars for hitting little milestones. However, using SQLite, a user can see their data over a long period of time in a variety of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This artifact shows real-world potential, as it is a very detailed recording of weight loss. By encouraging users to focus on short-term success, they will feel more encouraged to continue. It will also mean that users log their data more often instead of once daily. This can show users how their body fluctuates over very detailed time frames, as well a high-quality look at their long-term success. This is why I chose this artifact for not only the software design enhancement, but also for the algorithm and data structure enhancement too. For this, I have upgraded many parts of app by including new data aggregations, iterations, lists and charts that show the data in a visual way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main highlight of this enhancement is the charting system, which can reflect a user’s data input over a time range of daily, weekly or yearly inputs. It reflects these in the form of line or bar graphs, which can be easily changed in the log review section. When changing the dates, a user will see every log for the selected day in the daily option. However, on the weekly or monthly, it takes the averages of the inputs for either the day of the week, or the month of the year. Besides the charting system, the overall basic data handling in the app was improved. This includes things like the dynamic goal weight changes, star updating system, and records showing specific things like records only showing for the selected day and the weight recording handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did meet my goal enhancements that I intended to in Module One. The charting system reflects the need I spoke about for having a reliable data handling system that accurately reflects small changes over a long period of time. Feeling the short-term success of weight loss encourages a user to continue their journey, which can then be further backed by looking at the positive changes over a much bigger picture. This application has preset years right now of 2020-2026, so it is able to accurately show the results of specific days years apart from each other. After this, charts could be analyzed to see patterns of improvement, and even see every log made in a day as an average over the scale of years. The only update that I would have to my outcome-coverage plans would be to improve the data handling more for the next milestone. While I will be working on the database aspect of this application for the next milestone, making the app healthier by improving the handling of this data with the increasing of capabilities will always be crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was improving this artifact, the main thing that I learned was that the app can get slow if you don’t optimize it while enhancing it. Things like data handling, UI issues, and anything that comes with changing code can severely slow down or crash the application. This was the main challenge that I faced, but keeping the code clean and well-sorted out helped a lot with navigation and correctly linking the java and XML files. By continuing to keep the code well-structured, I am only helping myself in the future when improving it then.
